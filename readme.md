____ABOUT Project________________________________________________________________________________

This directory contains a notebook with a trained and tested NLP multiclassification Model.
Trained using an NN Algorithm and a large corpus Healthcare Dataset. The current accuracy 
of the model is 89%, however this is not for commercial use as there has been limited
testing on bias. The directory also contains a Flask application to show a basic web page 
example of the models predictive capabilities. Sufficient commenting and explanation in both 
the notebook and the application is provided to ensure a good learning environment for anyone 
that studies it.
